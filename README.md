# WhataDaeWines
WhataDae' Vinyard is now making wine available for shipping straight from our vinyard. We want to showcase a small wine catalog for customers to order online during the off peak months.  Customer will be able to create an order by choosing what type of wine and how much of it. There will be special pricing options based on Quantity ordered. This app is a way customers can enjoy their favorite wine all year long!
